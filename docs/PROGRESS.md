# Progress Log

What has actually been built, in the order it happened, and what was learned
doing it. Newest first.

This is the narrative record. Two other places describe state and neither
replaces this one:

- [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) is the plan, item by item.
- [`architecture/security.md`](./architecture/security.md) section 13.0 is a
  checked control-by-control inventory of what exists.

If those two disagree with this file, they are wrong: update them here first
and propagate. The reason for saying so is that they have already drifted once.

### A frontend test runner, on the units where a defect is a security defect

The one Phase 1 gap most worth closing first, because the type checker had been
the only gate and two of the three defects it let through were security
defects. Vitest with jsdom, and 44 tests over the pure logic the adversarial
review had already found holes in: `safe-redirect` (the backslash open-redirect
that survives a prefix check), the chat SSE schema and reader (the OpenAI
envelope that an earlier flat schema silently stripped to nothing, plus the
error, malformed, truncation and abort frames), `api-client` (the CSRF header
attached only on mutations and only when the cookie is present, the 401 that
becomes an `UnauthorizedError` and an event, and the absence of any
`Authorization` header), and the password schema's length-and-strength
threshold.

Two decisions worth the note. The `@/` alias is resolved in `vitest.config.ts`
directly rather than through a tsconfig-reading plugin, so the test setup does
not depend on how that plugin parses config. And the jsdom environment runs on
`https://localhost/` because the CSRF cookie carries the `__Host-` prefix,
which jsdom's cookie jar correctly refuses to store over http, so a test on
http would have been asserting against a control that the browser also drops.
The test files are excluded from `tsconfig.json` so `next build` does not try
to type-check them.

What is not covered: nothing renders a component or drives a browser yet. The
sign-in and enrolment screens, which are the surface where a defect is a
security defect, are still only reachable through their schemas and hooks in
these tests. Playwright is the deferred increment, recorded in `ROADMAP.md`
Phase 3.

### Closed the network exposure the review left standing

The sharpest finding, recorded as accepted risk §15.5, is now fixed rather than
carried. The gateway and the tailnet admin entrance shared the `app` Compose
network, and the tailnet entrance trusts `Tailscale-User-Login` outright, so a
compromised gateway could reach `admin-tailnet:8001` by service name and forge
an administrator. Socket binding, the design's stated isolation, protects the
host-published port but not the Docker service name.

The single `app` network is split so the gateway shares none with either admin
entrance. The data plane gets `gateway-data` (internal, for postgres and redis)
and `gateway-egress` (for the host runtime); the control plane gets `admin-data`
and a per-entrance control network carrying the frontend and its admin API.
postgres and redis are the only members of both database segments, which is
safe because they accept connections and never open one — a shared datastore is
not a shared path. The same split also stops the internet-facing public frontend
from reaching the tailnet entrance.

The invariant is not a comment but something `docker compose config` can be
asked: the intersection of the gateway's networks with each admin entrance's is
empty. What remains open is the deeper §6 defence, per-service database
credentials, so a compromised gateway cannot read or write the control plane's
tables; the forged-header path specifically is gone.

### Five adversarial reviews, and the twenty-eight defects they found

The admin API was attacked by five independent reviews, each on one surface:
authentication and sessions, authorization and data exposure, persistence and
concurrency, the model lifecycle and jobs, and the frontend/backend contract.
Their findings were verified before acting, and the verification mattered:
several passed against the in-memory fakes while being wrong in Postgres, and
one review's headline claim needed a real database to confirm.

Most of these were introduced by the two admin-API commits above. The fixes
are in four commits after this one; what follows is why they existed.

**Four defects made the system unusable.** Every admin call 404'd, because the
Next.js rewrite keeps the `/admin` prefix and the routers mounted at the root;
nothing caught it because every test called the ASGI app directly, so they
exercised handlers and never the contract. No API key could be issued, because
the expiry field is an `<input type="date">` that sends a naive datetime and
comparing it to an aware `now` raised `TypeError`, a bare 500. Both create
paths destroyed their one-time secret, returning the unsaved entity whose
`created_at` is null, which the frontend's parse rejects after the row exists,
taking the plaintext key and the invitation link with it. And a compromised
gateway could authenticate as an administrator: it shared the `app` Docker
network with `admin-tailnet`, which binds `0.0.0.0` and trusts
`Tailscale-User-Login` outright, so §5.1's "isolation by socket binding" held
for the host-published port but not the bridge. (Closed since, by the network
split described in the entry above.) That last one is the sharpest lesson:
making the tailnet entrance a full API is what opened it, and it was invisible
while the entrance mounted only health.

**Controls the design claimed and the code did not deliver.** The login
throttle refused on a per-account count alone, which is the hard lockout §5.3
forbids because it is a denial-of-service lever against a named person, and a
successful login cleared the per-address counter so one valid account could
reset it. A `user` could mint an unmetered gateway key, because the gateway
reads `rate_limit_rpm <= 0` as no limit and quota zero as no quota, and expiry
had no upper bound. The country filter was absent from the public admin
entrance while four places said it was present, one of them a router comment.
CSRF was absent from the tailnet entrance on the false premise that it has no
ambient credential, when `tailscale serve` attaches the identity header to any
request a hostile page can provoke.

**State and data corruption.** A failed load wrote `error` and then raised,
and the raise rolled the write back, so a half-resident model read as
`downloaded` and the budget under-counted it. The three transient states were
permanent dead ends after a crash, escapable only by SQL. The download task
held one transaction open for the whole multi-hour pull. Two full-row `save`
calls could revert a concurrent revoke or disable. Each of these had a passing
test that used an in-memory fake with no transaction and no row lock, which is
why the new coverage runs against real Postgres.

The lower-severity findings — a `user` role wider than §5.2, a challenge that
outlived a disable, two CSRF paths that 500'd, `GET /api-keys` loading full
user entities, a double SSE terminal frame — are in the fourth fix commit.

**What was checked and found sound, so it is worth recording as tested:**
session fixation and the watermark invalidation, TOTP replay across every skew
case, the bootstrap atomicity, enumeration resistance, the model-reference
grammar (`fullmatch` closes the trailing-newline hole and the registry
allowlist rejects `hf.co.evil.com`), the streaming slot released within a
millisecond of disconnect, and the migrations round-tripping with zero ORM
drift.

**Residual items, accepted or deferred rather than fixed:**

- **Commit-after-response.** FastAPI commits the request transaction after the
  response is sent, so a create returns `201` with the body before the INSERT
  is attempted; a constraint violation then has nowhere to report. The
  narrow trigger is a TOCTOU on a uniqueness check under concurrent identical
  creates. Structural to how the yield-dependency session works; not changed.
- **A model stuck in a transient state by a bare container crash** (not a
  `compose` restart) is reconciled only at the next deploy, because
  provisioning runs in the `migrate` service. `restart: unless-stopped`
  brings the container back without re-running it.
- **The concurrent-load budget race** is narrowed, not closed: `LOADING` is
  now committed independently and counted, so the window is milliseconds
  rather than the whole load, but two loads landing in that window can still
  both pass. A node advisory lock would close it and is deferred.
- **`session_signing_key`** is enforced as a production secret and read by
  nothing: sessions are opaque Redis ids by design. Left in place, noted here.

### The rest of the admin API

Models and their lifecycle, downloads as background jobs, routing policies,
API keys, the remainder of `/users`, the dashboard, and `/admin/chat`. An
integration test now walks Phase 1's stated goal in one sequence: register a
model, bind a routing policy to it, issue a key, and read the dashboard back.

**A gap that only appeared once the endpoints existed: nothing could create a
node.** Models attach to one, and `security.md` §7.2 says a node write
endpoint must ship with the SSRF guard, because a node record is an address
the platform will then make outbound requests to. So a fresh deployment could
register nothing at all. Phase 1 is single-node by definition, so the node is
named in configuration and written at admin start instead. That keeps the rule
intact rather than working around it: nothing accepts an address from a
caller, and the write endpoint still waits for the guard.

**`last_used_at` is derived, not stored.** The frontend wanted the column, and
maintaining one would mean the gateway writing to `api_keys` on every request
— which is precisely what the least-privilege split in §6 exists to prevent.
The same fact is already in `usage_records`, written by the account that
should write it and indexed on `(api_key_id, at)`, so it is one aggregate at
list time. The dashboard's 24-hour figures come from there too; the frontend
schema had them as Phase 2, but Phase 2 is live metrics from Prometheus, and
request and token counts have been in the database since Phase 1.

**Model reference validation moved onto the port.** Registering a model needed
the same check the Ollama adapter already performs, and importing it into the
application layer would have been the layering violation fixed a day earlier.
Putting it on `ModelRuntimePort` is the better answer anyway: what counts as a
reference differs by runtime. Ollama takes `namespace/name:tag` from a small
set of registries, MLX takes a HuggingFace repository id, vLLM will take a
path. A shared helper would have to be the union of all of them, which is no
grammar at all.

**Where the state machine can lie.** Most of the model tests exist for
failures that leave a plausible-looking row. A failed load writes `error`, not
`loaded`. A failed *unload* writes `loaded`, not `error`, because as far as
anyone knows the weights are still resident and the memory budget has to keep
counting them. A crashed download writes `error` in a `finally`, since a row
stuck in `downloading` is one no later operation will touch and nothing sweeps
up. Deleting a model whose alias a routing policy names is refused: no foreign
key enforces that binding, and without the check inference starts answering
"no available model" with nothing in the registry to explain why.

The download job runs detached, in its own transaction, because the request's
session is closed the moment the response is sent. It does not survive a
restart, which is accepted rather than solved: a durable queue is a second
piece of infrastructure to run for one operation, and keeping progress in the
cache means an interrupted pull is visibly stuck rather than silently gone.
The set of strong task references in `infrastructure/jobs.py` is not
decoration — `asyncio` holds only weak ones, and a task nobody keeps can be
collected mid-await with nothing logged.

Two smaller things. SSE framing moved into one module, so the gateway and the
chat panel cannot drift into two envelope shapes; that drift is exactly what
made the chat panel display nothing the first time. And the runtime port now
declares `AsyncGenerator` rather than `AsyncIterator`, because every consumer
wraps it in `aclosing()` and only the former promises `aclose()` — the
promise the whole streaming contract rests on.

### Admin authentication, end to end

Both admin entrances now resolve an identity, and a fresh deployment can get
from an empty database to a signed-in user on the public entrance. That path
is covered by an integration test which runs bootstrap, invitation, TOTP
enrolment, login and sign-out against a real Postgres, because none of the
unit tests would notice a composition root that wired the wrong adapter in.

Built: argon2id, pyotp, Fernet encryption for the TOTP secret, token issuing
and recovery codes, the audit adapter, sessions on the existing `CachePort`,
CSRF, the two identity resolvers, and the use cases behind them.

**Authentication was built before the CRUD, and the ordering paid off twice.**
Both times the shape of the existing schema rejected the first design rather
than accepting it quietly.

**The check constraint refused the obvious place to keep a pending TOTP
secret.** Enrolment spans two calls: one renders the QR, the other verifies a
code from the authenticator that scanned it, so the secret has to survive
between them. Writing it to the user row looked right, since
`can_use_public_entrance` already requires a password as well and a row with
only a secret authenticates nothing. But `users` carries
`(password_hash IS NULL) = (totp_secret IS NULL)`, added in the last review,
and it rejected the write. The constraint was right: a half-finished enrolment
is not an account. The candidate now waits in the cache for minutes, which is
better on its own terms. Abandoning a re-enrolment leaves the working
authenticator untouched, an unproved secret exists nowhere for 72 hours, and
the unauthenticated `begin` endpoint no longer writes to `users` at all.

**Creating an account and its invitation in one transaction violated a foreign
key.** The ORM models declare foreign key columns but no `relationship()`, so
SQLAlchemy's unit of work has no dependency graph to order a flush by, and
with `autoflush=False` — which production uses deliberately — the invitation
INSERT was emitted before the user it referenced. `PostgresUserRepository.save`
now flushes. This is the mirror of the defect found last time, where the tests
relied on an implicit flush that production does not do; here the production
code relied on an ordering nothing guarantees, and only a real database could
say so.

**A test-only hang that is worth recording.** The first end-to-end test opened
both entrances as concurrent `TestClient`s. It hung forever. `init_engine`
holds one engine per process and asyncpg connections belong to the event loop
that created them, so the second client's requests waited on futures from the
first client's loop. Production never meets this, because the entrances are
separate containers. The test opens them one after the other.

**And a latent ordering bug in the suite itself.** A unit test configures an
unreachable database to prove `/readyz` can fail, and cleared the `lru_cache`
on `get_settings` going in but not coming out. `alembic/env.py` overwrites
`sqlalchemy.url` with `get_settings().database_url`, so every integration test
that ran afterwards migrated against a dead host. It had never shown up
because the integration suite is skipped unless `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set,
and the two had not been run together.

**Three decisions worth their reasoning.**

`PasswordHasherPort` is async, and the adapter runs argon2 in a bounded thread
pool. A hash occupies a core for tens of milliseconds, and login is
unauthenticated and behind no WAF, so a synchronous port would hand an
attacker a cheap way to stall every request in the process, including the ones
that would have rate limited them. anyio's default 40 threads at 64 MiB each
would then trade a CPU stall for an out-of-memory kill, hence the semaphore.

Audit rows are written in their own transaction. `session_scope` rolls back on
any exception, so an audit row sharing the request's session disappears
exactly when the request failed, and failures are what an audit log is for.
The cost is the mirror case, an audited action that later rolls back, which is
what `outcome` is for.

The entrances choose their identity resolver by dependency override, and the
placeholder raises. A branch on `settings.auth_mode` would have been a string
comparison deciding a trust model, which is the thing section 5.1 says the
isolation must not rest on. An application that installs neither resolver now
fails on its first authenticated request rather than defaulting to anything.

Two things changed outside the plan. `users` gained a `created_at` column,
because the frontend user schema already displayed one and no column existed.
And the invitation QR endpoint takes the token on its URL: the recipient is
not signed in, so there is no session to identify the enrolment from, and an
`<img>` cannot carry a request body.

Still absent, and the reason the frontend is not yet usable end to end: models,
routing policies, API keys, jobs, dashboard, `/admin/chat`, and the rest of
`/users`.

### Theme and progress tracking

Deep blue theme, a busy indicator, and this file.

The palette is computed rather than chosen by eye: `#1e40af` measures 8.72:1
against white, which clears AAA for body text, and dark mode moves up the ramp
to `#60a5fa` at 7.79:1 against the dark background rather than reusing a value
that would be unreadable there. Charts use a sequential ramp, because the
dashboard shows magnitude over time and a categorical palette would imply
categories that do not exist.

Two decorative elements adapted from Uiverse.io, credited in
[`ATTRIBUTIONS.md`](../ATTRIBUTIONS.md). Only two, and only decorative: that
collection is thousands of pieces by as many authors with no shared design
language and, being showcases, generally no focus or disabled states. Useful
for a spinner, wrong for anything a user operates.

**No logo.** A constructed wordmark and an N-as-routing-graph icon were drawn
and then discarded; the identity will come from elsewhere. There is no icon
asset in the repository, so the browser tab falls back to the framework
default until one is supplied.

### Everything the adversarial review found, fixed

Five independent reviews were run against the codebase, each attacking a
different surface. Their findings were verified before acting, which mattered:
the loudest one was wrong.

**The claim that did not survive verification.** A review argued that streaming
requests never commit their usage record, because FastAPI closes a
yield-dependency before a streaming response is produced. The reasoning was
sound and the conclusion was false for the installed version. An empirical test
showed both paths persisting. A second review found why: FastAPI 0.139 keeps
the dependency scope open until the response is sent, but the declared floor
was `>=0.115`, and versions in between do not. So the real defect was a
dependency range, not a design fault, and the fix was a pin plus the
regression test that had been missing.

**Live security holes, since the gateway is the only exposed surface.**
Scopes were computed and then never consulted, so any valid key could consume
the hardware regardless of what it was issued for. The per-key quota was dead
in two independent ways. `rate_limit_rpm` was stored end to end and enforced
nowhere. `TAILNET_IP` had no required-variable guard, so an unset value made
Compose bind the gateway to every interface, which was verified before and
after.

**The one worth remembering.** The quota read `tokens_used_today` off the key
repository through a `getattr` fallback that returned zero when the method was
missing. The method lives on a different class. The fallback had been written
to make the check stubbable in tests, and it was precisely what hid the
miswiring: the only object with that method was the test double, so the tests
passed while production never checked a quota at all. A defensive default
around a wiring mistake is worse than the crash it prevents.

**Frontend.** The chat could never display a reply: the frame schema described
a flat shape while the backend sends the OpenAI envelope, and zod strips
unknown keys rather than rejecting them, so every real frame parsed
successfully into an empty object. The login page was an open redirect via
`/\evil.example`, which the URL parser normalises to a second slash. One-time
secrets could be destroyed with the Escape key. `Me` carried no `id`, so two
callers substituted `login` and one of them left an admin able to delete
themselves.

**Persistence.** Single use was not single use: the atomic guard was correct
and its rowcount was discarded, so two requests reaching the same invitation
both believed they had claimed it. TOTP replay prevention compared a value
read earlier and wrote it back, which two concurrent requests both pass.
Invariants that existed only as Python properties are now check constraints.

**Documentation.** Several controls were described in the present tense and did
not exist. The worst was in `db.py`, whose docstring asserted that each service
connects with its own least-privilege account and that "the grants do the
enforcing", while Compose gives every service one account that owns the schema.
That is the same mistake `security.md` had already warned about for tenant
isolation: a claimed boundary stops people looking for the risk.

**Two defects were found by the new tests rather than by review.** Splitting a
use case into two generators reintroduced a missing `aclosing` one layer up,
caught immediately by the disconnect test. And aligning the test sessions with
production `autoflush=False` produced foreign key violations, because the tests
had been relying on an implicit flush that production does not do.

### Guardrails that were configured but never read

Four settings existed in `config.py`, in `.env.example` and in the
documentation, and were read by nothing.

`/readyz` returned hardcoded booleans, so it could never produce a 503, and its
test asserted only that the status was one of 200 or 503 and therefore passed
vacuously. Anything gating a rollout on readiness was gating on a constant. It
now probes the database, cache and runtime concurrently, each bounded by a
timeout, because a probe that hangs is worse than one that fails: the
orchestrator waits instead of acting.

The country filter did not exist at all. `geoip2` was a dependency,
`allowed_countries` and `geoip_db_path` were read by nothing, and
`CountryNotAllowedError` was defined and never raised, which is worse than
absence because a defined error implies a control. It now refuses to start in
production when its database file is missing, rather than silently serving
every country.

`max_context_length` was likewise inert, so a prompt of any size was accepted.
And `/docs` was gated on `not is_production`, but `ENV` defaults to development
and `.env.example` ships it, so a deployment that filled in its secrets and
left the top of the file alone was publishing its full internal schema.
Exposure is now an explicit opt-in, so forgetting fails closed.

### Phase 1 backend, end to end

Postgres repositories and the first migration, the Ollama adapter, and the
chat path wired from socket to SSE frames.

The runtime is stubbed in the end-to-end tests and nowhere else. Inference
needs a GPU and can only be verified on the Mac Studio; everything between the
socket and the port boundary is real, including the routing policy read from
the database.

Three defects found while building: `.env.example` shipped a `DATABASE_URL`
whose password did not match `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, so a fresh checkout could not
connect; `alembic/script.py.mako` was missing, so revision generation failed
outright; and `key_id` was an independent random value that appeared nowhere in
the token, leaving verification no way to find the row short of scanning every
key.

### Scaffold

Backend hexagonal skeleton, Next.js management UI, Compose topology, AGPL-3.0.

The hardware constraint that shaped the deployment: **model runtimes cannot run
in Docker on macOS**, because containers there have no GPU access. A
containerised Ollama would be CPU-only and MLX would not run at all, which
defeats the point of the machine. Runtimes are native under launchd; containers
reach them through `host.docker.internal`.

Three image-build defects that only appeared by actually running
`docker compose build`, all of which `docker compose config` validated happily:
four services declaring `build:` while sharing one tag raced to write it,
`package.json` had no `packageManager` for corepack to activate, and neither
build context had a `.dockerignore`, so the host's `node_modules` and a Windows
x86 `.venv` were being copied into Linux images.

### Licence: AGPL-3.0

Chosen to match the sibling project, Smart-MultiAgent-Platform, so code can
move between them without a licensing question, and held by the research
centre rather than an individual so that people moving on does not create a
reattribution problem.

Section 13 is why this is not merely administrative here. Unlike the GPL, the
AGPL treats network interaction as distribution, and this platform exposes both
a public inference API and a public management UI. Anyone reaching those
endpoints is entitled to the source of the running version, which makes it an
operational obligation: keep the deployed revision published and identifiable,
not just ship a LICENSE file. Recorded in `deployment.md` section 8.1 for that
reason.

### The public entrance, and the risks accepted with it

The original plan was Cloudflare Tunnel. It was dropped after checking two
things rather than assuming them.

`rcsl.online` is served by Gandi nameservers and the domain is actively
receiving mail through Gandi, so moving nameservers touches mail delivery on a
shared domain maintained by someone else. And Cloudflare's free tiers fix the
origin response timeout at 100 seconds, which streaming survives but a long
non-streaming completion does not.

So public traffic goes through the existing openresty proxy at NTNU instead. A
wildcard DNS record already points every subdomain there, so no DNS change is
needed; what is needed is that the proxy host joins the tailnet and forwards
two hostnames. Three consequences were accepted deliberately and are recorded
in `security.md` section 15 with the conditions that should trigger revisiting
them: inference traffic passes through a third party in plaintext, there is no
edge WAF or DDoS protection, and the country filter is bypassable by anyone
with a VPS in the right country.

The second of those is why the resource guardrails matter more here than they
would behind a CDN. They are not one layer of several; they are the only one.

### Architecture documents

Six documents, and the decisions behind them.

The one that shaped everything else: the gateway and the admin API must be
separate containers, because the isolation has to come from socket binding
rather than from a path rule in a reverse proxy that one typo could undo. That
in turn made the two admin entrances separate ASGI applications, since the
tailnet entrance trusts an identity header outright and sharing a socket with
the public entrance would let a forged header grant administrator access.

Authentication moved from OIDC to invitation-only local accounts with mandatory
TOTP, on the reasoning that the platform was already invitation-only in effect
(the `users` table gates access, not the identity provider), so the real choice
was who verifies the password. The trade is explicit: no external dependency
and no account an administrator did not create, in exchange for owning password
storage, reset, lockout and second-factor handling permanently. Mandatory TOTP
is what makes that trade acceptable.

A hardware constraint found while writing these, not while coding: model
runtimes cannot run in Docker on macOS, because containers there have no GPU
access. It contradicted the stated goal of keeping the host clean and was
non-negotiable, so the documents changed rather than the plan.

---

## Where things stand

Phase 1's functionality is complete. Inference, authentication on both admin
entrances, and the management API are all built and tested, and every screen
in the frontend now reaches a real backend. The remaining Phase 1 items are
operational rather than functional.

Nothing has run on the Mac Studio yet. Everything so far is verified on a
Windows development machine, which means GPU inference, the tailnet entrance,
and nginx behaviour are all unverified by construction.

Two things exist as an API with no UI: routing policies, which are editable
only with curl, and the download progress endpoint, which the models table
polls but no page surfaces on its own.

## What comes next

### Phase 1, to finish it

1. **A frontend test runner.** No Vitest, no Playwright. Three frontend
   defects shipped together because the type checker was the only gate, and
   two of them were security defects. More pressing now than it was: the
   sign-in and enrolment screens are real, and they are the surface where a
   defect is a security defect.

2. **Database account split, and Docker secrets on the Compose side.** Both
   are documented as if they exist; `security.md` section 13.0 now says
   plainly that they do not. With the network split (§15.5) closed, the
   account split is the remaining control-plane hardening item: it is the
   deeper defence against a compromised gateway, denying it write access to
   `api_keys` and `users` rather than only a path to the admin socket.

3. **A routing policy editor.** The API is complete and audited; there is no
   screen for it, so the one thing that makes the gateway serve anything is
   currently configured by hand.

### Then: deploy to the Mac Studio for the first time

This is a milestone in its own right because several things can only be tested
there, and because it needs another person.

- Install Ollama natively under launchd as a dedicated service account, bound
  to `127.0.0.1`.
- Ask the NTNU proxy administrator for four things, listed in `ROADMAP.md`:
  join the tailnet under `tag:ntnu-proxy`, add two nginx server blocks, issue
  Let's Encrypt certificates, and confirm no request-body logging.
- Work through the pre-launch checklist in `security.md` section 14. Several
  items say to test rather than assume, and mean it: the forged
  `Tailscale-User-Login` case, the forged `X-Forwarded-For` case, and
  `AUTH_MODE=dev` refusing to boot under `ENV=production`.

### Phase 2 and beyond

Detail in `ROADMAP.md`. The parts that will need real design work rather than
implementation:

- **A second runtime adapter** (vLLM or MLX). Worth doing early even if unused,
  because it is the only real test of whether the hexagonal layering delivered
  what it was chosen for. If adding one requires touching a use case, the
  abstraction failed.
- **Multi-tenancy.** Currently single tenant, stated as such. The Phase 1
  schema was written not to preclude it, but adding `tenant_id` touches every
  repository and the filter has to be injected inside the adapter so a caller
  cannot forget it.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**, which replaces the static memory budget with
  live metrics.
- **A second compute node**, which is the point of the node abstraction and
  will be the first time routing has more than one place to send anything.

### Open decisions

- **Whether to move `rcsl.online` to Cloudflare**, or register a separate cheap
  domain for the data plane. Either removes the accepted risk in `security.md`
  section 15.1, where inference traffic passes through a third-party machine in
  plaintext. Deferred, not settled.
- **Where the identity comes from.** No logo; the drawn one was rejected.
- **Whether the admin API should be reachable publicly at all.** It is designed
  for it and the entrance exists, but nothing depends on it yet, and closing it
  would remove an entire attack surface. Worth asking again once the tailnet
  entrance is in use and it is clear who actually cannot install Tailscale.

### Standing risks to revisit

`security.md` section 15 records four accepted risks with the conditions that
should trigger reconsidering them. The one most likely to change is 15.1: if
the platform starts handling personal or IRB-regulated data, plaintext
inference traffic through a third-party proxy stops being acceptable and the
Cloudflare question above becomes urgent rather than optional.
